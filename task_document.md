### Task 1 - (1.5 Marks)
Within the context of this Data Scientist's Notebook, the Eigenvector centrality value outlines a person who is not just well-connected but connected to other well-connected individuals or companies. 

In this dataset, a high eigenvector centrality is likely influential in the network, sitting on many boards or highly connected amongst companies. A lower eigenvector score shows the opposite, a director with little influence or connections to other board members or companies.

The Degree centrality stat counts the number of direct links a node has. 

A high degree centrality for a director means they sit on the boards of many companies. Such individuals may not be connected to powerful nodes, but their broad reach suggests operational or advisory influence across many firms, which is relevant for identifying prolific or versatile professionals.

A new measurement we've added is:

<b> Betweenness centrality. </b>

This measurement measures the amount of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes. In the context of the data, a high betweenness measure tells us an individual may serve as a connector or bridge between two or more disconnected groups or individuals. 

A further extrapolation would be that using this measurement could result in finding individuals who are highly involved in the flow of communication or information between firms.

This aligns with our project goals because individuals with high eigenvector, degree and betweenness scores might hold sway over major business decisions or industry-wide strategies.
